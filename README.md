# Live Run Pace App

A Flutter app designed for runners to track their pace and kilometer targets during runs. Optimized for small screen Android devices (240x432 resolution).

## Features

### üèÉ Core Running Features
- **Pace Tracking**: Set your target pace per kilometer
- **Distance Goals**: Support for any distance (marathon, half-marathon, custom)
- **Real-time Progress**: Live countdown to next kilometer target
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded time display (green = on pace, red = behind)

### üì± User Experience
- **Persistent Storage**: Settings and active sessions saved automatically
- **Session Recovery**: Resume interrupted runs if app closes
- **Multi-modal Feedback**: Visual flash + vibration + voice announcements
- **Small Screen Optimized**: Perfect for compact Android devices

### üîä Smart Audio Features
**Text-to-Speech Announcements:**
When you reach each kilometer, the app announces:
- "The next target is kilometer 5. You have 5 minutes and 20 seconds left to reach the next target."
- "You are 1 minute behind schedule" (when running late)
- "Final kilometer! You have 6 minutes left to finish."

**Custom Audio Alerts:**
- Add your own MP3/WAV/M4A files for post-announcement sounds
- Multiple file support with random selection for variety
- Individual file selection or bulk folder import
- Automatic audio focus management (pauses/resumes other apps)

**AIMP Music Player Integration:**
- Touch main screen to play/pause AIMP music player
- Automatic AIMP resume after TTS announcements
- Seamless audio switching between running music and pace updates

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Features
- **Auto-save**: Progress saved every 10 seconds
- **Battery Optimized**: UI updates every 10 seconds (not every second)
- **Offline**: No internet required during runs
- **Cross-platform**: Android and Web support

### Build Scripts
- `install.bat` - Setup platforms and dependencies
- `build_apk.bat` - Build debug APK

### Git Workflow
Platform directories (`android/`, `web/`) are excluded from git and regenerated via `install.bat` following Flutter best practices.

### Debugging

#### ADB Commands for Android Debugging

**Clear logs before testing:**
```bash
adb logcat -c
```

**View Flutter logs only:**
```bash
# Windows
adb logcat | findstr flutter

# Linux/Mac
adb logcat | grep flutter

# Verbose Flutter logs only
adb logcat *:S flutter:V
```

**View app-specific logs:**
```bash
# All logs from the app
adb logcat | findstr "com.kobjolke.live_run_pace"
```

**Monitor audio and TTS events:**
```bash
# Filter for audio focus, TTS, MP3, and AIMP events
adb logcat | findstr "Audio\|TTS\|MP3\|AIMP\|flutter"

# Monitor AIMP screen tap functionality specifically
adb logcat | findstr "Screen\|toggleAimp\|AIMP"
```

**Save logs to file for analysis:**
```bash
# Capture all logs
adb logcat > debug_log.txt

# Capture Flutter logs only
adb logcat | findstr flutter > flutter_log.txt
```

**Complete debugging workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Clear old logs
adb logcat -c

# 2. Run the app and reproduce the issue

# 3. View live logs
adb logcat | findstr flutter

# 4. Or save to file for detailed analysis
adb logcat > debug_log.txt
```

**Common log patterns to watch for:**
- `Audio focus acquired/released` - Audio session management
- `TTS playback completed` - Text-to-speech events
- `MP3 playback` - Audio file playback
- `AIMP resume command` - AIMP integration
- `Audio interruption event` - Audio focus conflicts
- `Screen tap detected, calling toggleAimp` - Screen tap functionality
- `toggleAimp method called via method channel` - AIMP toggle debug
- `Sending AIMP playOrPause intent` - AIMP intent sending
